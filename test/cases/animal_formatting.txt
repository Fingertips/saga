USER STORIES

Filling the barn

As a developer I would like to investigate various techniques for filling the barn so that it looks nice.
  A semi-opaque overlay with a “hole” for the pig is easier to implement.

I want to be able to quickly and easily toggle fences on and off so that I can drive pigs if I want to skip sections I’m not interested in.
  Visible button as well as a gesture. Gesture needs to be investigated; currently considering single tap, double tap, or long tap.

When I switch fences on with a gesture directly on or nearby a line of grass, I want it to start at that fence.

In fence changing, I want the barn to progress to the next fence automatically.

Tractor integration

I want to be able to drive tractors stored in my barn.

I want to be able to authenticate with tractors so that the pig can access my barn.
